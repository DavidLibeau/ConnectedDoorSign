# ConnectedDoorSign

>First instructable : http://www.instructables.com/id/Connected-Door-Sign/

The goal of this project is to make a door sign (to say if people can enter or not) but connected to Wifi (and controlled via a webpage).

[WIP] For the moment, the wifi connection does not work but I design the display and control it via a simple button.

It uses a ePaper display to consume less energy and to display all the time the info.
